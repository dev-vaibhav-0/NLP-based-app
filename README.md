# 🧠 NLP GUI Playground  

This is a simple little project where you can play around with **Natural Language Processing** through a nice **Tkinter GUI**.  
No command-line stress — just type some text, click a button, and see the magic.  

What it can do right now:  
- 🎭 **Sentiment Analysis** → figure out if text feels positive, negative, or neutral  
- 🏷️ **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** → find names, places, organizations, etc.  
- 😃 **Emotion Detection** → spot feelings like joy, anger, sadness, etc.
